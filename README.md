All about 1 sample T Test, 2 sample T Test and Paired T Test

1. T Tests are used to compare means of a sample and the population through which that sample has been taken.
2. We then formulate a null hypothesis and an alternate hypothesis, calculate the P-value and then reject or accept the Null Hypothesis
3. In this example, for 1 sample t test we will compare average age of voters in USA and NYC.
4. For 2 sample t test, we will compare average age of voters in NYC and Georgia.
5. For paired t test, we will test if a drug has a significant affect on the weight of a sample group of people by comparing the weight before and after taking the drug
